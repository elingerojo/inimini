<p>Disputes with other users</p>
<p>We encourage you to contact the other Roast.gg user and try to resolve the dispute amicably.</p>
<p>If the users are unable to resolve a dispute related to a transaction on our website, Roast.gg will attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith, and based solely on our interpretation of our policies in our sole discretion; we will not make judgements on legal issues or claims. Roast.gg has no obligation to resolve any disputes.</p>
<p>You release Roast.gg from any claims, demands, and damages that arise out of disputes with other users or parties.</p>
<p>Disputes with Roast.gg</p>
<p>If for any reason you are upset with us, please let us know, and we will hopefully resolve the issue. In the event that we can't, then these rules will govern any legal dispute over our services.</p>
<p><p>A. Governing Law. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p>
<p>B. Arbitration. You and Roast.gg agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them here or by calling the AAA at 1&ndash;800&ndash;778&ndash;7879). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis--class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Roast.gg are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in &ldquo;small claims&rdquo; court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</p>
<p>C. Costs of Arbitration. Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $1,000, Roast.gg will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</p>
<p>D. Forum. We&rsquo;re based in Austin, Texas, so any legal action against Roast.gg related to our Services must be filed and take place in Austin. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be Austin. For any actions not subject to arbitration, you (where your contract is with Roast.gg, Inc.) and Roast.gg agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Travis County, Texas or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, or (where your contract is with Roast.gg Ireland UC) you and Roast.gg agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.</p>
<p>E. Government Exception. If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Texas.</p>
<p>F. Modifications. If we make any changes to this &ldquo;Disputes with Roast.gg&rdquo; section after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against Roast.gg prior to the date the changes became effective. Roast.gg will notify you of substantive changes to the &ldquo;Disputes with Roast.gg&rdquo; section at least 30 days prior to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send Roast.gg a written notification (including email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and Roast.gg in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Disputes with Roast.gg&rdquo; section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to your rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current version of the Terms.</p>
